# Personal_Projects
Little projects and scripts that I devised to help me with homework, or other tidbits for fun


At this time, I consider all code in this repo free to use, distribute, and re-distribute under two caveats:
-- if you use/modify this code, include my name as an original source
-- if you are a student, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THIS CODE FOR USE IN YOUR OWN SCHOOL WORK.

As I, too, am a student, I do not wish to have my own academic integrity questioned. If you are a student, then I respectuflly
request that you leave my code alone and write your own. That's how we learn! However, you are more than welcome to learn from
my code to aid in your understanding of the materials.

For non-students, enjoy my code. All I ask is that, as a courtesy, you include a reference to me/my code and that you openly
and freely distribute it with others. 

Because free beer is good beer
(even if it's Busch, Coors, etc.)
