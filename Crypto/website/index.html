    <p>
        Welcome to Crypto Practice! The site was created for my own benefit while
        taking MATH 445 at the University of Arizona. However, I figured that I
        could develop this site even further so that it could be distributed and
        used by everyone. It's not the prettiest thing in the world -- its
        underlying code is ugly and not the most web-friendly -- but it can reliably
        produce simple-enough problem sets for the user to work on.
